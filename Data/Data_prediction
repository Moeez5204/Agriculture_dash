The predicted values from 2024 to 2027 are generated using a linear regression model trained solely on the year as the predictor. This approach inherently assumes a continuous linear increase in yield, influenced heavily by the sharp yield rise observed in the 2020â€“2023 window. The model does not incorporate other agronomic or climatic features, nor does it apply any smoothing or regularization, which results in an exaggerated and potentially unrealistic projection pattern. The absence of domain features and the use of a simplistic extrapolation over a limited feature set are key reasons for the observed prediction shape.
